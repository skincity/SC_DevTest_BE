BE Developer home assignment 

Design and build a RESTful API to serve as the backend for a skin condition wiki. Use a js library of your choosing. It should
support the following features:

● A client can create a skin condition in the service
● A client can modify a skin condition they have created
● A client can delete a skin condition they have created
● A client can view all skin conditions in the service
● A client can view all skin conditions they have created

You can store the data in an in-memory database or connected it to an SQL database of your choice. 
Add tests you feel are needed.

Feel free to include a client app to visualize the wiki if you wish to show off your fullstack skills.

Include a README that describes how to build and run the solution.
Share the complete solution with us in a public source repository or via email in a zip.
